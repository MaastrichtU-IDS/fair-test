`fair-test` is a library to build and deploy [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) metrics tests APIs, supporting the specifications used by the [FAIR Metrics Working Group](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics), that can be queried to assess if a resource is complying with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

It aims to enable python developers to easily write, and deploy FAIR metric tests functions that can be queried by various FAIR evaluations services, such as [FAIR enough](https://fair-enough.semanticscience.org/) and the [FAIRsharing FAIR Evaluator](https://fairsharing.github.io/FAIR-Evaluator-FrontEnd/).
