`fair-test` is a library to build and deploy [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) metrics tests APIs supporting the specifications used by the [FAIRMetrics working group](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics). 

It aims to enable python developers to easily write, and deploy FAIR metric tests functions that can be queried by various FAIR evaluations services, such as [FAIR enough](https://fair-enough.semanticscience.org/) and the [FAIRsharing FAIR Evaluator](https://fairsharing.github.io/FAIR-Evaluator-FrontEnd/)

FAIR metrics tests are evaluations taking a subject URL as input, executing a battery of tests (e.g. checking if machine readable metadata is available at this URL), and returning a score of 0 or 1, with the evaluation logs.

> Feel free to create an [issue](/issues) on GitHub, or send a pull request if you are facing issues or would like to see a feature implemented.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How it works

The user defines and registers custom FAIR metrics tests in separated files in a specific folder (the `metrics` folder by default), and start the API.

Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib). Tested for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
