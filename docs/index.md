[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fair-test)](https://pypi.org/project/fair-test) [![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/fair-test)](https://pypi.org/project/fair-test)

`fair-test` is a library to build and deploy [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"} metrics tests APIs supporting the specifications used by the [FAIRMetrics working group](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics){:target="_blank"}. 

It aims to enable python developers to easily write, and deploy FAIR metric tests functions that can be queried by various FAIR evaluations services, such as [FAIR enough](https://fair-enough.semanticscience.org/){:target="_blank"} and the [FAIRsharing FAIR Evaluator](https://fairsharing.github.io/FAIR-Evaluator-FrontEnd/){:target="_blank"}

FAIR metrics tests are evaluations taking a subject URL as input, executing a battery of tests (e.g. checking if machine readable metadata is available at this URL), and returning a score of 0 or 1, with the evaluation logs.

    Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/fair-test/issues){:target="_blank"} on GitHub, or send a pull request if you are facing issues or would like to see a feature implemented.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How it works

The user defines and registers custom FAIR metrics tests in separated files in a specific folder (the `metrics` folder by default), and start the API.

Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib){:target="_blank"}. Tested for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
